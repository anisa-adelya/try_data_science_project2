# Detecting Parkinsonâ€™s Disease using XGBoost
This project is used to perform detection on Parkinson's disease. The dataset used is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system that affects mobility and causes tremors and stiffness. 
It has 5 stages and affects more than a million people each year in India. It is chronic and there is still no cure. This is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the dopamine-producing neurons in the brain.
XGBClassifier, or Extreme Gradient Boosting Classifier, is a machine learning algorithm that falls under the category of gradient boosting. It is particularly effective for classification tasks. XGBClassifier is an enhanced version of the gradient boosting algorithm that aims to improve both predictive power and computational efficiency.



In this Python machine learning project, we will use Python libraries such as scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, and xgboost to create a model using the XGBClassifier. The project involves the following steps:
1. Loading the data
2. Obtaining the features and labels
3. Scaling the features
4. Splitting the dataset
5. Generating an XGBClassifier
6. Calculating the accuracy of the model.
